# test_loaf.md

This repository has been set up to provide a test space for working on GitHub and learning how to generate and maintain content. 

Importantly, it will focus exclusively on bread - if bread ain't your thing, you're in the wrong place! I'll mainly be using this as an ongoing space for recording bread recipes and useful stuff (bakers' percentages, timings etc.).
